Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a technique used to analyze and visualize data to summarize its main features, identify patterns, detect outliers, and check assumptions. It helps in understanding the dataset before applying statistical models or machine learning algorithms. EDA involves using tools like summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to gain insights into the data.
